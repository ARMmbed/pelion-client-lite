## Device Management Client Lite API

This is the Doxygen-generated API documentation for Device Management Client Lite. See the [Files](files.html) section for documentation about a specific API. See also [Device Management documentation](https://www.pelion.com/docs/device-management/current/welcome/index.html).

Client Lite high-level APIs allow developers to create client side applications that connect to **Device Management**, with LwM2M features as described in the [Lightweight Machine to Machine Technical Specification](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_0-20170208-A/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M-V1_0-20170208-A.pdf).

These APIs enable you to:

- Securely communicate with internet services over the industry standard TLS/DTLS.
- Manage devices.
- Fully control the endpoint and application logic from the service side.
- Provide functionality to update the devices over the air remotely controlled from the service side.

The API (C code) allows quick application development and portability.
